# Machine Learning Models

## 1. Basic ML Model:
A general template that includes:
- Preliminaries: Loading required libraries and importing data
- Preparing the data: Scaling, cleaning data.
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Classifiers: KNN and Random Forests
- Validation metrics for classifiers


## 2. Debating Motions Classifier:
Classifies motions into categories such as 'Economics' and 'Politics' using Bag of Words and Multinomial Naive Bayes.

## TODOs:
- Write class for training ML models
- Write class for training Keras models
- Write class or tool for grid-searching models and recording results
